"Your goal is do develop an MNQ trading strategy that makes $100 per day (equivalent of 50 points of MNQ).  You may only use OHLCV NQ Continuous data for backtesting.  I do not care how you accomplish this but you must meet these guidlines.

1. Can only trade 1 MNQ at a time.
2. You may use any order types you like (market, limit, stop loss, target, trailing stop with offset, etc).  
3. Any trade that makes 5 points should not lose money.
4. If you lose $50 or more (equivalent to 25 points), stop trading until the next session opens (6 PM EST).
6. You can only have 1 losing day per week.  If you have a second loss you must wait for the followoing week open (Sunday Evening 6 PM EST)
7. Futures close Friday at 5 PM and reopen Sunday at 6 PM.  You can not carry contracts during this period.
8. You can not carry contracts past market close on any day.
9. Use any and all aggressive scalping and/or trading techniques you can find.  I would suggest research and testing.
10. No forward look-ahead bias allowed.  Your strategy can change week to week or even day to day but it must be back-testable.
11.  I would suggest breaking up the day into "observe" times and "trade" times.  Learn the algorithmic trading patterns that are happening on any given day, then trade them until they fail.
12. Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when every day has either made $100 or lost $50." --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "COMPLETE"
