# Macro Strategy Briefing — February 27, 2026

## Section 1: Rates, Credit & Liquidity

### Executive Summary
- **Curve flattening resumes**: 10Y-3M compressed 2bps to 34bps despite stable nominal yields — this is growth concerns bleeding through, not Fed pivot hopes.
- **TGA drainage accelerating**: $25.1bn drawdown in one session injects liquidity exactly when credit spreads are tightening (IG -1bp, HY -3bps) — classic late-cycle dissonance where Treasury liquidity can't offset credit repricing.
- **Real yields disconnecting from nominals**: 10Y TIPS dropped 1bp while 10Y nominal was flat — breakevens are compressing (5Y5Y -1bp to 2.13%, now 10th percentile), signaling deflationary growth shock fears trumping sticky inflation prints.

### What Changed
**Rates:**
- 2Y rose 2bps to 3.45% while 10Y/30Y unchanged = **bear flattening at the front end**. This is the market pricing out rate cut expectations after yesterday's defensive equity rotation. The 2Y move matters because it's still at 6th percentile (z=-1.28) — we're re-steepening from deeply inverted levels, but the front end is getting anchored.
- **10Y-3M spread compression (-2bps to 0.34%)** is the critical signal. This spread sits at 77th percentile but is narrowing exactly when it should be widening if growth were stable. Yesterday's cross-asset action (defensives up, tech crushed, gold/crude both down) screamed growth scare — today's curve flattening confirms it.

**Inflation Complex:**
- 5Y5Y forward inflation dropped 1bp to **2.13% (10th percentile, z=-1.4)** — this is a 5-year forward, 5-year implied inflation rate sitting near decade lows despite Core PCE at 100th percentile (z=+2.28). **This divergence is the macro story**: the market is pricing stagflation → disinflation → potential deflation, while current prints remain scorching hot. The bond market is looking through the lag.
- 10Y TIPS real yield fell 1bp to 1.77% while nominal 10Y was flat = **1bp of breakeven compression**. Real yields at 13th percentile mean the market isn't demanding inflation premium despite 100th percentile current inflation readings.

**Credit:**
- IG spreads tightened 1bp to 80bps (49th percentile) and HY tightened 3bps to 294bps (50th percentile). **This is the problem from yesterday bleeding into today**: credit is repricing like nothing happened, sitting at median levels, while equity volatility spiked, defensives outperformed by 400bps, and growth scare signals lit up across macro. HY at 294bps should be 320-340bps given the equity structure break.
- The IG/HY spread ratio (3.68x) remains compressed. Historical stress episodes see this push to 4.5-5.0x. **Credit is 3-4 weeks behind the equity volatility curve.**

**Liquidity:**
- **TGA drawdown of $25.1bn** (now $887.6bn, 93rd percentile) is injecting reserves exactly when RRP rose $2.64bn to $3.80bn total. The RRP number is now insignificant (23rd percentile) — that facility is drained. TGA drainage means Treasury is spending down cash, which adds reserves to the banking system. This is mechanical bid support.
- Fed Balance Sheet rose $402mm to $6.614tn (10th percentile). QT continues at a trickle, but the TGA move dominates the weekly liquidity impulse. **Net liquidity injection of ~$25bn this week** should be supporting risk assets, yet NQ sold off 118bps yesterday.

### Regime Assessment
**Current State: Transitioning from Normal to Restrictive**

The regime indicators say "normal" for yield curve and liquidity, "tight" for credit. **Bullshit.** The qualitative overlay matters more:

1. **Yield Curve**: Sitting at 60bps (10Y-2Y) but *compressing* at the 10Y-3M tenor while front-end real rates are rising = this is the early phase of a policy mistake repricing. When 10Y-3M breaks below 25bps, the recession probability jumps to 40%+. We're at 34bps and falling 2bps/day.

2. **Credit**: Spreads are tight by percentile but *not adjusting* to the equity vol regime shift. VIX fell 1.62 points today but came off a 60th percentile close at 17.93 after spiking from <15 two weeks ago. HY OAS should have widened 10-15bps this week; instead it tightened 3bps. **This is complacency, not stability.**

3. **Liquidity**: TGA drainage is bullish mechanically, but the Fed Balance Sheet at 10th percentile means the underlying QT grind continues. The liquidity injection is temporary — when TGA refills (likely late March/early April for tax season), you get a $100-150bn liquidity drain over 3-4 weeks.

**Regime Shift Trigger**: If 10Y-3M breaks 25bps, HY OAS moves above 310bps, or 5Y5Y inflation drops below 2.00%, the macro regime flips to full restrictive/recessionary. Equity multiples compress 10-15% in that scenario.

### Key Levels / Risks to Watch

**Rates:**
- **10Y-3M spread: 34bps** — break of 30bps accelerates growth scare pricing. Next support at 25bps = recession signal.
- **2Y yield: 3.45%** — if this moves above 3.55% (back to December levels), the Fed cut narrative dies and front-end real rates become restrictive enough to break credit.
- **5Y5Y inflation: 2.13%** — break of 2.00% would put it at 5th percentile, signaling outright deflationary expectations. That's a macro regime change.

**Credit:**
- **HY OAS: 294bps** — needs to widen to 310bps minimum to reflect equity vol regime. If it stays below 300bps into next week while VIX holds >16, the dislocation becomes a trade: short HYG vs long TLT, targeting 50bps of HY widening.
- **IG OAS: 80bps** — stable, but watch for 85bps break. IG tends to lead HY by 1-2 weeks in repricing events.

**Liquidity:**
- **TGA level: $887.6bn** — if this drops below $850bn, the weekly drainage rate is unsustainable and Treasury will need to refill. That's your liquidity cliff.
- **RRP: $3.80bn** — functionally zero. No buffer left. When TGA refills, reserves get drained directly from bank balance sheets = tighter financial conditions.

**Overnight Risk:**
- PCE data drop next week (March 3-5 window likely). Consensus is 0.3% MoM for Core PCE. If it prints 0.4%+, the 5Y5Y inflation collapse accelerates (market prices stagflation → hard landing), and HY spreads finally gap wider by 15-20bps overnight.

## Section 2: Equity Strategy

### Executive Summary
- **Negative gamma regime intensifying**: ES closed 24 points below gamma flip at 6858 per yesterday's data; today's -0.54% decline to 6909 means you're now ~50 points below neutral — dealer flow is amplifying every downtick by 7-10 points of forced selling.
- **Defensive rotation accelerating into Day 2**: Financials +121bps, Industrials +63bps, Real Estate +44bps while Tech -140bps — this isn't profit-taking, it's a **style rotation out of duration/growth into value/cyclicals**, exactly what happens when the curve flattens and growth scares emerge.
- **Small-cap surge (+52bps RUT) disconnected from rate reality**: Russell ripping while 2Y yields rise 2bps and 10Y-3M compresses makes no fundamental sense — this is a technical squeeze or passive rebalancing flow, not a sustainable reversal. Fade it.

### What Changed

**Index Action:**
- **NQ underperformed SPX by 64bps** (Nasdaq cash -118bps vs SPX -54bps). This continues yesterday's thrashing where tech ate a -263bps loss vs defensives up 183bps. The **cumulative 2-day underperformance in mega-cap tech is now 180-200bps** — that's a regime change, not noise.
- ES at 6909 (using SPX as proxy) is **50 points below the 6858 gamma flip level from yesterday**. Assuming that level didn't shift dramatically, you're deep in negative gamma territory where every 10-point ES decline forces dealers to sell 7-8 points of exposure to stay delta-neutral. This becomes a death spiral if ES breaks 6750 (yesterday's key support level).
- **Russell 2000 +52bps** is the outlier. Small caps rallied on financials strength (XLF +121bps) and industrials (XLI +63bps), which have higher weight in RUT. But small caps are *more* rate-sensitive than large caps, and 2Y yields rose today. This move is either: (a) a technical squeeze on crowded small-cap shorts, or (b) month-end passive rebalancing flow. **It's not fundamental and won't hold.**

**Sector Forensics:**
- **Financials +121bps**: This is the steepening trade (10Y-2Y still at 60bps, 77th percentile) + credit spread tightening (IG -1bp, HY -3bps). Banks make money on steep curves and tight credit. But if HY spreads widen to 310bps+ as they should, XLF gives back 80-100bps in a week.
- **Tech -140bps**: XLK now down 403bps over two sessions. Nasdaq 100 peso flows (Mag 7 concentration) mean this is AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL selling. The move is **fundamental**: long-duration assets reprice when real rates rise (10Y TIPS was 1.77%, up from cycle lows) and growth expectations fall (5Y5Y inflation at 2.13%, 10th percentile).
- **Defensives holding**: Utilities -38bps, Staples -17bps is actually *relative outperformance* vs XLK -140bps. Yesterday XLU/XLP were +183bps vs XLK -263bps (446bps spread). Today that compressed to 122bps, but the **2-day cumulative defensive outperformance is 568bps** — that's a top-decile macro hedge signal.

**Factor Breakdown:**
- **Momentum -58bps**: MTUM tracks mega-cap tech and high-beta winners. This factor dies in volatility regime shifts. It's now underperforming 2 straight sessions.
- **Size +73bps**: Small-cap factor ripping is the Russell effect. This is mean reversion from oversold, not a new trend.
- **Min Vol +40bps**: Low-volatility stocks outperforming is classic risk-off. When USMV outpaces QQQ by 180bps (back-of-envelope from Nasdaq -118bps today), you're in a defensive regime.
- **Value -57bps, Quality -32bps**: These should be winning in a defensive rotation, but they're both slightly negative. This tells you the market isn't rotating into classic value (energy, financials) — it's rotating into *low-beta defensives* (staples, utilities). That's a macro hedge, not a growth-to-value rebalancing.

**Volatility:**
- VIX closed 17.93, down 1.62 points but still at 60th percentile (z=-0.19). The absolute level (18) is the "elevated but not panic" zone. The *structure* matters more: VIX was sub-15 two weeks ago, spiked to 20+ mid-week, and is now oscillating 17-19. This is **elevated baseline volatility** = every dip gets sold, every rip gets faded.
- NFCI (Chicago Fed Financial Conditions) at -0.56 (14th percentile) says financial conditions are *loose*. This is the same dissonance as tight credit spreads vs elevated VIX. The NFCI is a lagging indicator that weights credit spreads and term spreads heavily — it doesn't capture the equity gamma dynamics or the cross-asset growth scare signals. **Ignore the NFCI this week; trade the VIX and sector dispersion.**

**Cross-Asset Signals:**
- **Gold +86bps**: Risk-off + real rates falling (10Y TIPS -1bp) = gold bid. This is the second session of gold strength while equities chop. Classic macro hedge activation.
- **Crude +5bps**: Oil is dead money. USO flat while growth scare signals flash everywhere = demand destruction fears are priced. If crude breaks below $77 (USO ~$78), it's a growth recession call.
- **TLT +40bps**: 20Y Treasury ETF rallying on flight-to-quality. This is the mirror of XLK -140bps — when duration works in bonds, it dies in equities. The 2-day TLT move is probably +80-100bps cumulative = a 7-10bp drop in long yields. That's a macro repricing event.
- **HYG -9bps**: High-yield credit ETF down slightly while HY OAS tightened 3bps (the index spread) — this is a liquidity/flow issue in the ETF wrapper. Institutional credit is tightening (the OAS), but retail is selling HYG. When these converge, HYG will catch down to fair value = another 50-75bps lower, which puts it at the 80.50 breakdown level from yesterday.

### Regime Assessment
**Current State: Negative Gamma Regime with Defensive Rotation in Progress**

You're in a **two-regime overlap**:
1. **Negative gamma**: ES below 6858 flip = dealers short gamma, selling into declines. This amplifies moves by 70-80%.
2. **Defensive rotation**: XLK underperforming XLU/XLP by 568bps over two days is a top-5% historical dispersion event. This happens in the first 2-3 weeks of a growth scare, before it either resolves (V-shaped recovery, defensive rotation reverses) or accelerates (full risk-off, defensives go flat, everything sells).

**The VIX regime at 18** says we're in the "chop zone" — not low enough to sell vol, not high enough to capitulate. This is the worst environment for directional positioning. You get whipsawed on every 50-point ES move.

**Regime Shift Triggers:**
- **Bullish resolution**: ES reclaims 6950 on volume, VIX breaks below 15, XLK outperforms by 100bps in a session = gamma flips positive, defensive rotation reverses, you get a melt-up into March. Probability: 25%.
- **Bearish acceleration**: ES breaks 6750, HYG breaks 80.50, VIX spikes above 22 = full risk-off, HY spreads gap to 320-340bps, equity multiple compression begins. Target: ES 6400-6500 (-5-7% from here). Probability: 40%.
- **Muddle-through**: ES chops 6800-6950 for 1-2 weeks, VIX oscillates 16-20, defensive rotation persists but doesn't accelerate = wait for the next macro catalyst (PCE data, NFP, Fed speak). Probability: 35%.

### Key Levels / Risks to Watch

**ES (S&P 500 Futures):**
- **Support: 6858 (gamma flip), 6750 (yesterday's key level)** — breaking 6750 activates the -5-7% leg lower to 6400-6500. That's where the next gamma flip sits (rough estimate).
- **Resistance: 6950 (round number + prior support), 7000 (psychological)** — need a daily close above 6950 on expanding volume to negate the breakdown risk. Until then, fade rips to 6930-6950.

**NQ (Nasdaq 100 Futures):**
- **Support: 24,000 (round number), 23,700 (Nov 2025 breakout level)** — using Nasdaq cash at 22,878 and typical NQ/NDX relationship, NQ is probably around 24,100-24,200 spot. Breaking 24,000 opens 23,500-23,700 = -3-4% from current.
- **Resistance: 24,500 (prior swing low), 24,800 (gap fill)** — any rip into 24,500+ is a fade in this gamma regime. You're selling into dealer covering, not buying breakouts.

**Sector Rotation:**
- **XLK: 215-220 range** — if XLK breaks 215 (rough current level minus 5%), it's a -10% correction from the January high around 235-240. That level (215) coincides with ES 6750 breakdown = systemic risk-off.
- **XLU/XLP: Watch for exhaustion** — if defensives go vertical (XLU +2-3% in a session), that's capitulation volume and a fade signal. We're not there yet; today was -38bps XLU, so the defensive bid is steady but not panicked.

**VIX:**
- **16 = lower bound of current regime**, 20 = upper bound. Break above 20 and hold = sellers in control, ES targets 6700-6750. Break below 16 and hold = all-clear signal, ES targets 7000+.

**Overnight Risks:**
- **Gamma acceleration if ES opens below 6850** — the first 30 minutes will see forced dealer selling if we gap down. That's your high-probability fade setup: let it puke to 6800-6820, then buy the first bounce for a 30-40 point scalp back to 6850-6860.
- **Russell squeeze continuation** — if RUT opens +1-2% on month-end rebalancing flow, it's a sell signal for large caps. The rotation will be so violent that algo desks will puke NQ/ES to fund the small-cap ramp. Use any RUT surge as a tactical NQ short entry.

## Section 3: Macro Outlook

### Executive Summary
- **Labor market re-tightening into stagflation**: Unemployment dropped 10bps to 4.30% (31st percentile) while CPI and Core PCE sit at 100th percentile (z=+2.25, +2.28) — this is the worst combination for Fed policy: inflation isn't rolling over, but growth is scarce enough that the curve is flattening and defensives are ripping.
- **Dollar collapse accelerating**: USD broad index at 117.99 (-24bps, 5th percentile, z=-1.49) is now at multi-year lows — this *should* be inflationary (imports more expensive), but the 5Y5Y inflation collapse to 2.13% says the market is pricing dollar weakness as a growth/confidence crisis, not a reflationary impulse.
- **Macro regime "risk-on" label is a lagging joke**: The quantitative model says "risk-on" while equity defensives outperform by 568bps over two days, the yield curve compresses, credit spreads are mispriced, and gold/TLT both rally. **The actual regime is transitioning from risk-on to risk-off, but the indicators haven't caught up.**

### What Changed

**Employment:**
- **Unemployment rate fell 10bps to 4.30%** (31st percentile, z=-0.68). This is a *tightening* labor market print, which normally supports risk assets. But paired with sticky inflation (Core PCE at 100th percentile), it removes the Fed's wiggle room to cut rates if growth slows. The unemployment rate at 4.30% is still elevated vs. the 3.5-3.8% range from 2022-2023, but the *direction* (falling) is what matters.
- **Initial claims +4k to 212k** (24th percentile, z=-0.48) = labor market remains tight. Claims below 220k historically mean no recession in the next 6 months. But the claims data is a lagging indicator by 4-8 weeks. If the growth scare accelerates, claims will spike to 240-260k by late March/early April.
- **Labor Force Participation rose 10bps to 62.50%** (21st percentile, z=-0.75). This is bullish for growth (more workers = more potential output) but bearish for inflation (tight labor market + rising participation = wage pressure stays elevated). The combo of falling unemployment + rising participation should be unambiguously good, but in a stagflation setup, it just means the Fed stays restrictive longer.

**Inflation:**
- **CPI All Items at 326.59 (100th percentile, z=+2.25)** and **Core PCE at 127.92 (100th percentile, z=+2.28)** = inflation is *still* running hot despite 18 months of restrictive policy (Fed Funds at 3.64%, 31st percentile but real rate = 3.64% - 2.28% Core PCE = +1.36%, which is restrictive). The fact that inflation sits at 100th percentile while 5Y5Y inflation expectations collapsed to 2.13% (10th percentile) is the **core macro dilemma**: current inflation is scorching, but the market prices disinflation/deflation ahead. One of these is wrong.
- The bond market is saying: "Inflation will break, but only after growth breaks first." That's a stagflation → hard landing → disinflation path. The equity market hasn't priced the "hard landing" part yet (SPX only -0.54% today, -2-3% from highs).

**Dollar:**
- **USD Broad Index at 117.99 (-24bps, 5th percentile, z=-1.49)** is a massive structural shift. The dollar is at levels not seen since early 2023. Normally, dollar weakness is reflationary (imports get expensive, inflation rises) and bullish for commodities/equities. But crude is flat (+5bps), gold is up only modestly (+86bps), and equities are chopping. This suggests the dollar decline is driven by **capital outflows or confidence loss**, not reflationary policy.
- A weak dollar *should* support US exporters and mega-cap tech (which gets 50-60% revenue overseas). Instead, XLK is down 140bps today and 403bps over two days. The dollar weakness isn't helping because the growth scare and multiple compression (real rates rising) overwhelm the FX tailwind.

**Macro Regime Indicators:**
- The model says **"risk-on"**, but this is backward-looking. Risk-on regimes are characterized by: tight credit spreads (check: IG/HY at median), low VIX (miss: VIX at 60th percentile and elevated), strong cyclicals (miss: XLI/XLE underperforming), weak defensives (miss: XLU/XLP outperforming by 568bps over two days).
- The regime is **transitioning from risk-on to risk-off**, but the quantitative models (which use moving averages and percentile ranks) haven't flipped yet. By the time they flip, you'll be 5-7% lower in ES.

### Regime Assessment
**Current State: Stagflationary Transition with Growth Scare Emerging**

The macro setup is **late-cycle stagflation with a growth scare accelerating**:
1. **Inflation remains sticky** (CPI/PCE at 100th percentile) despite restrictive policy.
2. **Growth expectations are collapsing** (5Y5Y inflation at 10th percentile, 10Y-3M spread compressing, defensive equity rotation).
3. **Labor market is tight enough** (unemployment 4.30%, claims 212k) that the Fed can't ease preemptively.
4. **Credit markets are mispriced** (HY OAS at 294bps, 50th percentile, should
