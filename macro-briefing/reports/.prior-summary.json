{"date":"2026-02-12","summary":"## Bottom Line\n\n**You're trapped in a negative gamma regime with deteriorating macro underpinnings and a credit market that's repricing 3-4 weeks too slowly.** The cross-asset signals are clear: defensives +183bps vs tech -263bps, gold/crude both -335bps, TLT rallying while commodities collapse = **this is a growth scare with sticky inflation, not a standard correction.** ES 24 points below its gamma flip (6858) and NQ deep in negative territory means every 10-point decline forces dealers to sell another 5-7 points — you're fighting dealer hedging flow, not fundamentals. **The regime shifts to full liquidation if ES breaks 6750, HYG breaks 80.50, or the next PCE print comes in hot (>0.3% MoM).** Until then, fade rips into resistance (ES 6950, NQ 24200), respect the defensive rotation (long XLU/XLP vs short XLK), and watch credit spreads obsessively — when HY OAS finally wakes up and moves to 3.00%+, the 5-10% equity leg lower begins immediately. Trade smaller, hedge gamma exposure, and prepare for 100+ point overnight gaps in either direction."}
