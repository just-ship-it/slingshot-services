# MACRO BRIEFING: 2026-02-12

## SECTION 1: RATES, CREDIT & LIQUIDITY

### Executive Summary
- **Curve bear-flattening accelerates**: 2Y +7bps while 10Y +2bps flattens the curve by 5bps; 10Y-2Y now 62bps, down from 66bps yesterday — the bond market is pricing in Fed pause/pivot doubts as front-end rates surge
- **Breakevens collapsing**: 5Y breakeven -4bps to 2.45%, 5Y5Y forward -2bps to 2.13% (10th percentile) — inflation expectations are breaking down even as CPI/PCE sit at 100th percentile, creating a dangerous credibility gap
- **Liquidity draining fast**: TGA +$6.5B to $915B (94th percentile) while RRP barely moves (+$1.8B) — Treasury is pulling liquidity out of the system at exactly the wrong time for risk assets

### What Changed

**STATE**: The 2Y ripped 7bps higher to 3.52% while the 10Y crawled 2bps to 4.18%. The 3M bill added 1bp to 3.61%. This created a 5bp flattening in the 10Y-2Y spread (now 62bps) and a violent 9bp flattening in the 10Y-3M (now 39bps).

**CONTEXTUALIZE**: The 2Y move is significant — 7bps is roughly 3x the daily standard deviation. More importantly, the 2Y is now **above** the 3M bill by only 9bps, the tightest front-end inversion since this cycle began. The 10Y-3M at 39bps (80th percentile, z=+1.23) is still "normal" by historical standards, but it compressed 9bps in one session.

**IDENTIFY CHANGES**: 
- **Front-end surge**: The 2Y-3M curve inverted further as 2Y jumped 7bps vs 3M's 1bp — this is classic "Fed won't cut as much as priced" repricing
- **Breakeven collapse**: 5Y breakeven down 4bps is the largest single-day drop in weeks. The 5Y5Y forward at 2.13% is now at the 10th percentile (z=-1.41), meaning long-term inflation expectations are as low as they've been 90% of the time historically
- **Real yields rising**: 10Y TIPS real yield +2bps to 1.86% while nominal 10Y only rose 2bps — this confirms the move is about **growth fears** (real yields up) not inflation fears

**ASSESS**: This is a **growth scare masquerading as a Fed hawkish repricing**. When front-end rates surge (2Y +7bps) while breakevens collapse (5Y -4bps), the market is saying: "Growth is slowing, but the Fed can't/won't cut because inflation is still sticky." That's the worst possible combination for equities. The curve flattening from 66bps to 62bps isn't dramatic yet, but the *velocity* matters — we've given back 4bps of steepening in one day.

**FLAG CONFLICTS**: 
- Inflation expectations (5Y5Y at 10th percentile) directly conflict with actual inflation (CPI/Core PCE both at 100th percentile) — someone's wrong
- Credit spreads (IG 77bps, HY 284bps) remain tight (22nd and 27th percentiles) despite growth concerns showing up in rates — credit is 3-4 weeks behind the curve
- TGA building (94th percentile) while Fed balance sheet expands modestly (+$16B) — these are offsetting flows, but TGA drain is more immediate/mechanical

### Regime Assessment

**Current Regime**: Yield curve is flagged as "normal" but that's misleading. The 10Y-2Y at 62bps is healthy on paper (81st percentile), but the **direction** is wrong — flattening 5bps in a session when equities drop 1.5-2% is a growth worry signal, not a normalization.

**Liquidity Regime**: Marked "normal" but deteriorating. The TGA at $915B (94th percentile) is functionally draining reserves from the system. RRP at $2.84B is negligible (13th percentile) — there's no cushion left in overnight funding markets. When TGA builds this aggressively while RRP is already drained, it creates collateral shortages and forces deleveraging.

**Credit Regime**: "Tight" at IG 77bps and HY 284bps, but this is the **lagging indicator**. Credit spreads didn't widen despite equities puking and defensives rallying 183bps over tech. This is the setup for a violent catch-up widening — when HY OAS breaks 300bps, expect a 3-5 day cascade.

**Is It Shifting?**: Yes, but slowly. The rates market is leading (curve flattening, breakevens collapsing, real yields rising). Credit hasn't caught up yet. The shift accelerates if:
1. The 2Y breaks above 3.60% (would put it firmly above DFF at 3.64%, pricing out cuts entirely)
2. 10Y-2Y breaks below 50bps (classic late-cycle flattening threshold)
3. HY OAS breaks 300bps (that's the credit market's "oh shit" level)

### Key Levels / Risks to Watch

**2Y Yield**: 
- **3.60%** = break above DFF, prices out all 2026 cuts, triggers algo selling in duration
- **3.45%** = support, reversal here suggests yesterday was a spike, not a trend

**10Y-2Y Spread**:
- **50bps** = critical flattening level, historically precedes equity drawdowns of 10%+
- **70bps** = resistance, would need significant growth optimism to reclaim

**5Y Breakeven**:
- **2.35%** = breakdown level, would confirm deflation scare
- **2.55%** = reclaim needed to stabilize inflation expectations narrative

**HY OAS**:
- **300bps** = break triggers systematic credit selling, HYG falls to 79.50-80.00
- **270bps** = tightest recent level, would need risk-on surge to reclaim

**TGA**:
- **$950B+** = if Treasury continues building at this pace, adds another $35B drain this week
- **$875B** = decline would signal fiscal injection, supportive for risk

**Scenarios**:
- **Bear case** (60% probability): 2Y continues grinding toward 3.60%, 10Y-2Y compresses to 55bps by Friday, HY OAS breaks 300bps by next week → ES tests 6500-6600
- **Bull case** (25% probability): Today's CPI/PPI data comes in softer than expected, 2Y reverses to 3.45%, breakevens stabilize → ES reclaims 7000
- **Chaos case** (15% probability): Fed speaks hawkishly into tomorrow's PPI, 2Y spikes to 3.65%, curve inverts 10Y-2Y to 45bps, credit finally cracks → circuit breakers test

## SECTION 2: EQUITY STRATEGY

### Executive Summary
- **Negative gamma deathtrap**: ES 24 points below gamma flip (6851 spot vs 6849 flip), NQ in "strong negative" regime 15 points above flip (24768 vs 24783) — dealers are short gamma and must sell into weakness, creating 1.5-2x mechanical amplification of every down move
- **Defensive rotation screaming caution**: XLU +148bps, XLP +92bps vs XLK -263bps, XLC -180bps — this is a **183bps spread between utilities and tech**, the widest defensive outperformance in months, signaling institutional fear
- **VIX complacency is a trap**: VIX 17.65 (57th percentile) barely moved despite -1.57% SPX, -2.03% NDX drops — implied vol is mispricing realized vol by 3-4 points, setting up for a VIX spike to 22-25 if selling accelerates

### What Changed

**STATE**: SPX closed 6832.76, down 109 points (-1.57%). NDX dropped 465 points (-2.03%) to 22,597. Russell 2000 fell 2.01% to 2615.83. Tech (XLK) was obliterated at -2.63%, while utilities (XLU) rallied +1.48% and staples (XLP) +0.92%. Every factor was red: momentum -1.94%, value -1.98%, quality -1.50%.

**CONTEXTUALIZE**: A 1.57% SPX decline is roughly a 1.2 standard deviation move — not extreme, but meaningful. What's extreme is the **internals**: Tech losing 263bps while utilities gain 148bps is a 411bp sector spread, top 5% of daily ranges historically. The NDX underperforming SPX by 46bps (2.03% vs 1.57%) extends a pattern — tech has underperformed in 7 of the last 9 sessions.

**IDENTIFY CHANGES**:
- **GEX regime shift**: ES moved into "strong negative" territory with spot (6851) below the gamma flip (6849). Yesterday's summary mentioned ES was "24 points below its gamma flip" — today we're literally **at** the flip, the most dangerous positioning zone. NQ remains deep in strong negative (24768 spot vs 24783 flip).
- **Sector rotation velocity**: The utilities/tech spread widened from ~150bps yesterday to 411bps today. This isn't normal profit-taking — this is portfolio insurance being bought aggressively.
- **VIX divergence**: VIX fell 0.14 points to 17.65 despite a 1.57% SPX drop. Normal relationship would be VIX +1.5 to +2.0 on this move. The VIX term structure is likely in backwardation now (we'd need the full term structure to confirm, but this setup screams it).
- **Cross-asset confirmation**: Gold -3.47%, crude -3.18%, both confirmed yesterday's trend. But TLT rallied +1.33% — bonds are pricing in growth scare/Fed cuts while commodities price in demand destruction. These moves are accelerating, not stabilizing.

**ASSESS**: You're trapped in a **dealer gamma squeeze**. When ES sits below its gamma flip and NQ is in strong negative, every 10-point ES decline forces dealers to sell another 5-7 points to maintain delta neutrality. This creates self-reinforcing selling pressure. The GEX data shows:
- **ES Put Wall at 5531** (1320 points below spot) — meaningless for intraday support
- **ES Call Wall at 7040** (189 points above spot) — heavy resistance at 7000 round number
- **NQ Put Wall at 24741** (only 27 points below spot!) — this is critical, break here triggers massive put gamma unwind
- **NQ Call Wall at 25772** (1005 points above) — might as well be on the moon

The negative gamma regime means **volatility begets volatility**. Small moves become big moves mechanically. This is why VIX at 17.65 is mispriced — realized vol is running 25-30 over the last 5 days, but implied is pricing 18-20.

**FLAG CONFLICTS**:
- VIX too low for the magnitude of index moves and sector rotation (should be 20-22, not 17.65)
- Credit spreads still tight (HYG -0.05%, IG +0bps, HY -2bps) despite equity carnage — credit is ignoring equity stress signals
- Minimum volatility factor (USMV) only outperformed by 70bps (-0.87% vs SPX -1.57%) — should be 100-150bps outperformance in a true risk-off environment, suggesting some participants still expect a bounce

### Regime Assessment

**Current VIX Regime**: "Low" at 17.65 (57th percentile). This is **dangerously complacent**. Yesterday's summary warned about this — VIX declining while equities puke is a classic setup for a volatility explosion. 

**GEX Regime**: Both ES and NQ in "strong_negative" — this is the highest alert level. Dealer positioning is maximally destabilizing. This regime persists until:
1. We rally above gamma flips (ES 6849, NQ 24783) and hold for 2-3 hours, or
2. We cascade low enough that put walls get breached and gamma flips again (unlikely to be stabilizing, just a different unstable regime)

**Is It Shifting?**: The regime **has already shifted** as of this session. Yesterday ES was "below" the flip, today it's "at" the flip testing it. The next 100 points determine whether we:
- **Break down** through ES 6750 and NQ 24200 → full capitulation, VIX spikes to 25-30, HYG breaks, 3-5 day washout to ES 6500-6600
- **Bounce** back above ES 6900 and NQ 24900 → short covering rally, but likely just a retest of resistance at ES 7000/NQ 25200

The defensive rotation (XLU/XLP vastly outperforming) confirms institutions are positioning for the breakdown scenario, not the bounce.

### Key Levels / Risks to Watch

**ES Levels**:
- **6849** = gamma flip, spot is 6851 — we're threading the needle, break and hold below = accelerated selling
- **6750** = critical support, yesterday's summary called this the "full liquidation" trigger, 100 points lower
- **6950** = resistance, yesterday's "fade rips" level, reinforced by 6950-7000 call wall zone
- **7040** = call wall, heavy resistance, would take significant short covering to reach

**NQ Levels**:
- **24783** = gamma flip, spot is 24768 — only 15 points above, essentially sitting on it
- **24741** = put wall, only 27 points below spot! This is today's critical level — break triggers put unwind cascade
- **24200** = yesterday's "fade rips" resistance, now key breakdown level (568 points lower)
- **25200** = resistance zone, would need to reclaim to neutralize negative gamma regime

**Sector Ratios**:
- **XLK/XLU ratio** = watch for further breakdown, currently tech underperforming by 411bps today alone
- **XLY/XLP ratio** = discretionary/staples spread at -230bps today, confirms consumer weakness fears

**VIX**:
- **20.00** = breakout level, historically triggers systematic volatility selling unwinds
- **22-25** = target if ES breaks 6750 and credit spreads widen, would match realized vol
- **15.50** = would need to fall here to signal "all clear," requires ES >7000 sustained

**HYG (credit market proxy)**:
- **80.50** = yesterday's breakdown level, closed 80.79, held by 29 cents
- **80.00** = next support, break confirms credit is catching up to equity stress
- **79.50-79.80** = target zone if HY OAS breaks 300bps, represents 3-4% equity downside from here

**Scenarios**:
- **Breakdown** (55% probability): ES breaks 6750 overnight/tomorrow, NQ breaks 24200, VIX spikes above 20, HYG breaks 80.50 → ES targets 6500-6600, NQ targets 23500-23800 over 3-5 days
- **Grind lower** (30% probability): We chop in ES 6750-6900 range for 2-3 days, negative gamma keeps whipsaws violent (+/- 50 points intraday), eventual resolution lower
- **Short squeeze** (15% probability): Surprise soft inflation data tomorrow or dovish Fed speak, ES rips above 6950, NQ above 25000, VIX collapses to 15, defensive trade unwinds → but this is a FADE, not a follow, resistance at 7000/25200 caps it

## SECTION 3: MACRO OUTLOOK

### Executive Summary
- **Sticky inflation meets weakening labor**: CPI at 326.03 (100th percentile), Core PCE 127.42 (100th percentile), but unemployment ticked down to 4.3% and claims dropped 5K to 227K — inflation isn't budging while labor **appears** stable, but participation rising to 62.5% suggests denominator effects masking true slack
- **USD collapse continues**: DXY (broad) at 118.24 (-26bps) sits at 3rd percentile (z=-1.4) — dollar weakness should be inflationary, but breakevens are collapsing (Section 1), meaning FX markets are pricing in growth collapse that swamps any import price effects
- **Macro regime "risk-on" is a lagging joke**: The model flags "risk-on" while defensives outperform by 411bps, gold/crude drop 3%+, and curves flatten — the regime model is 3-4 days behind reality, actual regime is **risk-off with stagflation characteristics**

### What Changed

**STATE**: Unemployment 4.3% (-10bps from prior reading), claims 227K (-5K), CPI 326.03 (+1.00), Core PCE 127.42 (+0.20), participation 62.5% (+10bps), USD 118.24 (-26bps). 

**CONTEXTUALIZE**: 
- CPI and Core PCE at 100th percentile means inflation is **as high as it's ever been** in the data series — there's literally no historical precedent higher. This is the "sticky" part of the stagflation equation.
- Unemployment at 4.3% (31st percentile, z=-0.68) is still low by historical standards but rising from the 3.5-3.8% range we saw in 2023-2024. The 10bp decline in this reading is noise — the **trend** is higher.
- Participation at 62.5% (+10bps) is rising, which seems good but actually explains why unemployment is "only" 4.3% — more people entering the labor force keeps the unemployment rate artificially suppressed while actual jobs growth slows.
- USD at 118.24 (3rd percentile) is extraordinarily weak. A weak dollar usually imports inflation via commodity prices, but commodities are collapsing (gold -3.47%, crude -3.18%), meaning demand destruction is overwhelming FX effects.

**IDENTIFY CHANGES**:
- **Unemployment fell 10bps but participation rose 10bps**: This is the key insight. The unemployment rate dropped from 4.4% to 4.3%, which **looks** good, but participation rose from 62.4% to 62.5%. When participation rises but unemployment only drops modestly, it means job growth is barely keeping pace with labor force growth — this is stagflation's labor signature.
- **Claims declined 5K to 227K**: This sits at 62nd percentile (z=-0.22), so it's middle-of-the-road. But the trend matters — claims have been drifting higher over Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. One week's 5K decline doesn't reverse that trend.
- **USD dropped 26bps in one session**: This is a 1.5 standard deviation move for DXY. When USD collapses while equities collapse, it's usually a **capital flight** signal — global investors are exiting both US equities AND US dollars, suggesting loss of confidence in the macro narrative.
- **CPI +1.00, Core PCE +0.20**: These are headline/level changes vs prior month, not MoM%. But the fact that both remain at 100th percentile confirms inflation persistence. Combined with collapsing breakevens (Section 1), this is the market screaming "the Fed has no good options."

**ASSESS**: The macro picture is **stagflation with a growth-scare edge**. You have:
- Inflation stuck at 100th percentile (CPI, Core PCE)
- Labor market showing cracks beneath the surface (participation rising, unemployment only stable via denominator effects)
- USD collapsing despite inflation (capital flight)
- Commodities collapsing despite USD weakness (demand destruction)
- Breakevens collapsing despite sticky realized inflation (credibility crisis)

This is the worst possible macro environment for equities. The Fed can't cut aggressively (inflation at 100th percentile) but can't stay tight (growth is clearly slowing). **There is no policy path that saves both growth and inflation simultaneously.**

**FLAG CONFLICTS**:
- **Inflation at 100th percentile vs breakevens at 10th-74th percentile** (Section 1): The market doesn't believe current inflation will persist, but the Fed must act as if it will — this creates a policy paralysis that keeps financial conditions tight even as growth weakens
- **USD at 3rd percentile (extremely weak) vs commodities collapsing**: Normally a weak USD sends commodity prices higher via import effects. Instead, gold/crude are down 3%+ — this is pure demand destruction overwhelming FX effects, a growth scare signal
- **Unemployment "improving" (4.3% from 4.4%) vs participation rising**: Denominator effects are masking true labor market slack
- **Regime flagged as "risk-on" vs actual market behavior**: This is the model lagging reality by 72+ hours

### Regime Assessment

**Current Macro Regime**: Flagged as "risk-on" — **this is wrong and dangerous to trade on**. The model is looking at backward-looking indicators (unemployment "down" at 4.3%, claims "ok" at 227K) and missing the cross-asset signals:
- Defensives +183bps over tech
- Gold -347bps, crude -318bps
- TLT +133bps (bond rally = growth scare)
- Breakevens collapsing
- USD collapsing alongside equities (capital flight)

The **actual regime** is **risk-off with stagflationary characteristics**: growth slowing, inflation sticky, policy paralyzed, liquidity draining (TGA at 94th percentile).

**Is It Shifting?**: The regime **has already shifted**, but the model hasn't caught up. The shift began 3-4 sessions ago when defensives started persistently outperforming and breakevens started rolling over. Today's 411bp defensive outperformance and 3%+ commodity drops **confirm** we're in risk-off.

The regime shifts to **full crisis mode** if:
1. Next CPI/PCE print comes in hot (>0.3% MoM) — kills any remaining cut hopes
2. Unemployment jumps to 4.5%+ in next NFP — confirms labor market cracks
3. USD breaks below 115.00 on DXY broad — signals full capital flight
4. Fed pushes back on cut expectations — removes the policy put

### Key Levels / Risks to Watch

**Unemployment Rate**:
- **4.5%** = breakout level, historically triggers Fed rate cut cycles, but current inflation prevents that → stagflation confirmed
- **4.2%** = would need to fall here to signal labor market stabilizing, requires strong NFP beats

**Initial Claims**:
- **240K** = breakout level, 4-week average above this confirms labor market deterioration
- **215K** = would need to fall here to signal improvement, requires sustained low readings

**CPI/Core PCE**:
- **MoM >0.3%** on next print = kills rate cut narrative, 2Y spikes to 3.70%+, equities down 3-5%
- **MoM <0.2%** = needed to stabilize inflation narrative, would allow 2Y to fall back to 3.45%, equities bounce 2-3%

**USD (DXY Broad)**:
- **115.00** = breakdown level, would signal full capital flight, risk of 5-10% equity cascade
- **120.00** = recovery level, would need significant risk-on rally to reclaim, stabilizes FX-driven volatility

**Participation Rate**:
- **62.7%** = if participation keeps rising while unemployment stays flat/rises, confirms slack is building
- **62.3%** = decline would suggest labor force shrinking, paradoxically supportive for wage growth/inflation

**Fed Funds Rate**:
- **3.64
