### Liquidity Spikes
- Large liquidity level movements signal increased volatility ahead
- Consider adjusting position sizing when liquidity spikes are detected

### GEX Level Touches

- Use GEX regime as a filter for level-based entries

### IV Events
- IV expansions typically precede directional moves
- IV contractions may signal mean reversion opportunities

## Methodology

- **Event Detection**: Events identified when metrics exceed threshold standard deviations
- **Forward Windows**: Price behavior measured at T+15m, T+30m, T+1h, T+2h, T+4h
- **MFE/MAE**: Maximum Favorable/Adverse Excursion measures best/worst price during window
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of events where price moved in favorable direction
