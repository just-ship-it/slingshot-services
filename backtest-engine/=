🔄 Ralph loop activated in this session!

Iteration: 1
Max iterations: unlimited
Completion promise: none (runs forever)

The stop hook is now active. When you try to exit, the SAME PROMPT will be
fed back to you. You'll see your previous work in files, creating a
self-referential loop where you iteratively improve on the same task.

To monitor: head -10 .claude/ralph-loop.local.md

⚠️  WARNING: This loop cannot be stopped manually! It will run infinitely
    unless you set --max-iterations or --completion-promise.

Tune the liquidity sweep detection system to achieve 50% accuracy. Follow the instructions in /home/drew/projects/slingshot-services/backtest-engine/scripts/ralph-sweep-tuning.md. Start by running a baseline test, then iteratively adjust parameters one at a time, testing after each change. Track progress and stop when accuracy 50% with at least 50 tradeable signals.
